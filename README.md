# SnapTextEffects

iOS app that allows users to create text with gradients or rainbows for use in Snapchat. This application became quite popular after being featured on a number of videos. It is currently on around 70,000 lifetime downloads. 


This app relied on a quirk in how Snapchat handles pasted text, which I believe has now been patched in later updates. The app would not correctly remove formatting data when text was copied and pasted from a webpage. Originally I made this app as a web app, but I decided to turn it into an iOS app to reach a wider market.

I am keeping the app on the App Store for those users who are still on an older version.
